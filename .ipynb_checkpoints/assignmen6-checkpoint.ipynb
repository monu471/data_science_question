    "\n",
    "To build a machine learning model for customer churn prediction, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data preparation:** Preprocess and clean the dataset, handle missing values, and perform any necessary feature engineering tasks like encoding categorical variables or scaling numerical features.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Split the dataset:** Divide the dataset into training and testing sets. Typically, you would allocate a larger portion (e.g., 70-80%) to training and the remaining to testing (e.g., 20-30%) for evaluating model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Select an algorithm:** Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm for churn prediction, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting models. Consider the characteristics of your dataset and the problem at hand when selecting the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Feature extraction:** Feed the pre-processed images through the pre-trained model to obtain deep features. These features capture high-level representations of the images' visual characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Model architecture:** Create a new shallow neural network architecture on top of the pre-trained model. Add fully connected layers and a softmax layer for classification. This new architecture will learn to classify images based on the extracted features.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Model training:** Train the combined model (pre-trained base + new layers) on the image dataset using techniques like backpropagation and gradient descent. Adjust the model's parameters to minimize the loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Fine-tuning:** Optionally, unfreeze some of the pre-trained layers and train them along with the newly added layers to adapt the model to your specific dataset. Fine-tuning allows the model to learn more specific features from the target domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Model evaluation:** Evaluate the trained model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score. Use a separate test dataset that wasn't used during training.\n",
